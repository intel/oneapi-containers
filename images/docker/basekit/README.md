# Intel<sup><font size=2>®</font></sup> oneAPI Base Toolkit

**Essential Kit for Diverse Workloads**

The Intel<sup><font size=2>®</font></sup> oneAPI Base Toolkit is a core set of tools and libraries for building and deploying high-performance, data-centric applications across diverse architectures.

It features the Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) language, an evolution of C++ that:
* Allows code reuse across hardware targets—CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs
* Permits custom tuning for individual accelerators

Domain-specific libraries and the Intel<sup><font size=2>®</font></sup> Distribution for Python provide drop-in acceleration across relevant architectures. Enhanced profiling, design assistance, and debug tools complete the kit. [Base Kit Details](https://software.intel.com/oneapi/base-kit)
