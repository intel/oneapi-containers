**Deploy oneAPI applications**

The Intel<sup><font size=2>®</font></sup> oneAPI Runtime Libraries is a core set of libraries for deploying high-performance, data-centric applications across diverse architectures.

It features the Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) language, an evolution of C++ that:
* Allows code reuse across hardware targets—CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs
* Permits custom tuning for individual accelerators
