  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999

  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

  Preamble
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
  and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to 
  guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
  software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially 
  designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software 
  Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we 
  suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
  General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, 
  based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. 
  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
  to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); 
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change 
  the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
  informed that you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors 
  to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These 
  restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
  copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a 
  fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must 
  make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other 
  code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, 
  so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the 
  library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know 
  their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, 
  and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, 
  distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no 
  warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else 
  and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the 
  original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected 
  by problems that might be introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free 
  program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the 
  users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. 
  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the 
  library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this l
  icense.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU 
  General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, 
  applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the 
  ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in 
  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared 
  library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a 
  derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License 
  therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria 
  of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for 
  linking other code with the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less 
  to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also 
  provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing 
  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary 
  General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides 
  advantages in certain special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the 
  widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto 
  standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the 
  library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as 
  widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by 
  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General 
  Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs 
  enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For 
  example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many 
  more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
  GNU/Linux operating system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' 
  freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the 
  Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a 
  modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
  follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
  library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived 
  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in 
  order to run.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program 
  which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized 
  party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General 
  Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as 
  "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as 
  to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those 
  functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has 
  been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either 
  the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work 
  containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with 
  modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
  "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
  modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source 
  code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
  files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the 
  library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
  this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using 
  the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only 
  if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use 
  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what 
  the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source 
  code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License 
  and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along 
  with the Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
  at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus 
  forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications 
  or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
  these conditions:

   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that 
   you changed the files and the date of any change.

   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all 
   third parties under the terms of this License.

   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of 
   data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other 
   than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a 
   good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
   such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever 
   part of its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose 
  that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, 
  Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by 
  this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
  square root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
  sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably 
  considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
  and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
  which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on 
  the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 
  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
  rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
  right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
  the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the 
  Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
  distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
  License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
  instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must 
  alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the 
  ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. 
  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
  has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not 
  make any other change in these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, 
  so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies 
  and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library 
  into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, 
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete 
  corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under 
  the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
  interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
  designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from 
  the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even 
  though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object 
  code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is 
  designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is 
  called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a 
  derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this 
  License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an 
  executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of 
  the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is 
  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of 
  such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is 
  part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of 
  the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is 
  especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the 
  work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely 
  defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts 
  and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less 
  in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of 
  whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object 
  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the 
  object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables 
  containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked 
  directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work 
  that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions 
  of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided 
  that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
  reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is 
  used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You 
  must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays 
  copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
  them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. 
  Also, you must do one of these things:

   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
   code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which 
   must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
   executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work 
   that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user 
   can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable 
   containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes 
   the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able 
   to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)

   b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A 
   suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library 
   already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library 
   functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified 
   version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
   version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

   c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
   give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a 
   charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

   d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a 
   designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified 
   materials from the same place.

   e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that 
   you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must 
  include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable 
  from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need 
  not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating 
  system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of 
  other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating 
  system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library 
  together in an executable that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
  side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not 
  covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that 
  the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other 
  library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
  things:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the 
   Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be 
   distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it 
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying 
   uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library 
  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, 
  modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will 
  automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who 
  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have 
  their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library 
  or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
  accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or 
  any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
  do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
  the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), 
  the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
  copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and 
  conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
  compliance by third parties with this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions 
  are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that 
  contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
  conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
  obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. 
  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
  of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
  you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and 
  the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
  other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
  section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
  distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
  distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
  distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
  choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
  consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain 
  countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
  copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit 
  geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
  distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such 
  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of 
  this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
  Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
  new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies 
  a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", 
  you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that 
  version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If 
  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any 
  version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs 
  whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author 
  to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
  Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
  for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free 
  status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and 
  reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
  THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
  STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
  LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
  PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU 
  ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
  REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
  LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
  THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), 
  EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
  DAMAGES.

  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

  [This is the first released version of the Library GPL. It is numbered 2 
  because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

  Preamble
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share 
  and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to 
  guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the 
  software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially 
  designated Free Software Foundation software, and to other libraries whose 
  authors who decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our 
  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
  distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), 
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
  the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
  can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny 
  you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions 
  translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the 
  library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a 
  fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must 
  make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, 
  and (2) offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, 
  distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone 
  understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is 
  modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that 
  what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by 
  others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish 
  to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually 
  obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into 
  proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent 
  must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU 
  General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, 
  the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated 
  libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to 
  read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the 
  ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they 
  blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program 
  and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the 
  library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to 
  running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and 
  legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the 
  original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License 
  for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most 
  developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might 
  promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of 
  those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. 
  This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of 
  non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a 
  user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in 
  them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, 
  but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the 
  Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free 
  libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
  follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
  library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived 
  from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General 
  Public License rather than by this special one.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a 
  notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may 
  be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also 
  called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as 
  to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those 
  functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has 
  been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means 
  either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to 
  say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or 
  with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
  "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
  modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source 
  code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
  files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the 
  library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by 
  this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using 
  the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only 
  if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use 
  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what 
  the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source 
  code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License 
  and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along 
  with the Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
  at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus 
  forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications 
  or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
  these conditions:

   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

   b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that 
   you changed the files and the date of any change.

   c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all 
   third parties under the terms of this License.

   d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of 
   data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other 
   than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a 
   good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
   such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever 
   part of its purpose remains meaningful.

  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose 
  that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, 
  Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by 
  this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
  square root function must still compute square roots.)

  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
  sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably 
  considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
  its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
  works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
  work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms 
  of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
  rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
  right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
  the Library.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with 
  the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
  distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
  License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
  instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must 
  alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the 
  ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. 
  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
  has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not 
  make any other change in these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so 
  the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and 
  derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library 
  into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, 
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete 
  corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under 
  the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
  interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
  designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code 
  from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, 
  even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
  object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is 
  designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is 
  called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a 
  derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this 
  License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an 
  executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions 
  of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is 
  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of 
  such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is 
  part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of 
  the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is 
  especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the 
  work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely 
  defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts 
  and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less 
  in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of 
  whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object 
  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the 
  object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables 
  containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked 
  directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work 
  that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions 
  of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided 
  that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
  reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is 
  used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You 
  must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays 
  copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
  them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. 
  Also, you must do one of these things:

   a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
   code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which 
   must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
   executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work 
   that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user 
   can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable 
   containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes 
   the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able 
   to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)

   b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, 
   to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a 
   charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

   c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a 
   designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified 
   materials from the same place.

   d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that 
   you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must 
  include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable 
  from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not 
  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) 
  with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system 
  on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the 
  executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of 
  other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating 
  system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library 
  together in an executable that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
  side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not 
  covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that 
  the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other 
  library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
  things:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the 
   Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be 
   distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of 
   it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the 
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library 
  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
  copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and 
  will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties 
  who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have 
  their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
  Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do 
  not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library 
  (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
  modifying the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), 
  the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
  copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and 
  conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
  compliance by third parties to this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) 
  that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
  conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
  obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. 
  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
  of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
  you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
  particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and 
  the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
  other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
  section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
  distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
  distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
  distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
  choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
  consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain 
  countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
  copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit 
  geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
  distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In 
  such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body 
  of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
  Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be 
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address 
  new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
  version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
  that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any 
  version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs 
  whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author 
  to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software 
  Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
  for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free 
  status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and 
  reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
  THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
  STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
  LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
  PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
  YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
  LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY 
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR 
  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA 
  BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER 
  OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
