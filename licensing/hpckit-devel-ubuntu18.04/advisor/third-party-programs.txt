All rights reserved.

Theo de Raadt <deraadt@openbsd.org> came up with the idea of using
such a mathematical system to generate more random (yet non-repeating)
ids to solve the resolver/named problem.  But Niels designed the
actual system based on the constraints.

Later modified by Damien Miller to wrap the LCG output in a 15-bit
permutation generator based on a Luby-Rackoff block cipher. This
ensures the output is non-repeating and preserves the MSB twiddle
trick, but makes it more resistant to LCG prediction.

Trial and Beta Licences 3.1 Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, if this is a trial licence, then: (a) clauses 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.8 shall not apply, and the Licensor instead hereby grants the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) a revocable, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-transferable and non-sublicensable licence to install, load, launch, access, run, execute, operate, and archive the Licensed Materials solely for the Licensee's (and its Affiliate(s')) internal evaluation and review purposes to determine whether to enter into a paid licence of the Software and not for any other purpose; (b) clause 12 shall not apply and these Terms shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue: (i) for a period of 60 days; (ii) until the parties enter into new terms for the licensing of the Licensed Materials; or (iii) until either terminated by either party, whichever is first; (c) clauses 5.1, 5.2, 6.1(d) and 8 shall not apply; (d) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) acknowledge that the Software may place watermarks on output (including any software that incorporates any part of the Software), have limited functionality, function for a limited period of time, or limit the functionality or time of functioning of any output. The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) acknowledge that access to and/or use of any files or output created with the Software is entirely at the Licensor's own risk; and (e) notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, the Licensor shall only be required to provide the Evaluation support services as described in paragraph 1.1(a)of Schedule 1. 3.2 During the Term, the Licensor may provide the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) with access to certain Beta Software to trial and test for and on behalf of the Licensor. Where the Licensor gives Licensee and its Affiliate(s) access to such Beta Software the Licensor licences it to the Licensee on a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable basis to install, load, launch, access, run, execute and operate the Beta Software solely for evaluation purposes and to provide feedback on that Beta Software. 3.3 In respect of the Beta Software, the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) agree that:
(a) the Licensor shall have no obligation to provide Support Services; and (b) clause 2.8, clause 9 (other than clause 9.1) and schedules 1 and 2 shall not apply and all other references to Support Services shall be deemed inapplicable. 3.4 Subject always to clause 9.1, the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) acknowledge in respect of its use of Beta Software, it is: (a) a beta version of the Software which may not have been sufficiently tested by the Licensor for general commercial release and therefore may contain bugs and Errors; (b) provided for test and evaluation purposes only; and (c) being used, tested and evaluated by Licensee and its Affiliate(s) at its own risk. 4. Additional licence usage terms 4.1 The Licensee may, from time to time during the Term, purchase additional Application(s), Licensee Developers and/or Production Environment(s) (together referred to as "Authorised Usage") in excess of the number set out on the Quote and the Licensor shall grant use of the Licensed Materials to such additional Licensee Developers in accordance with the provisions of these Terms. 4.2 If the Licensee wishes to purchase additional Authorised Usage, the Licensee shall notify the Licensor in writing. The Licensor shall evaluate such request for additional Authorised Usage and respond to the Licensee with approval or rejection of the request. 4.3 If the Licensor approves the Licensee's request to purchase additional Authorised Usage, the Licensee shall, within 30 days of the date of the Licensor's invoice, pay to the Licensor the relevant fees for such additional Authorised Usage, such fees to be notified by the Licensor to the Licensee in writing. 5. Charges, invoicing and payment 5.1 The Licence Fees will be invoiced by the Licensor annually in advance upon the Effective Date and, thereafter, on each anniversary of the Effective Date during the term of these Terms. 5.2 The Annual Renewal Fee will be invoiced by the Licensor annually in advance upon the Effective Date and, thereafter, on each anniversary of the Effective Date during the term of these Terms. 5.3 The charges for the Annual Renewal Fee shall be subject to annual review and may be increased by the Licensor, on 30 days' prior written notice to the Licensee, not more than once in any 12-month period, with no such increase exceeding the equivalent of the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index over the 12-month period immediately preceding the notice of increase. 5.4 Unless otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, all amounts referred to in these Terms are exclusive of value added tax ("VAT") which, where chargeable by the Licensor, shall be payable by the Licensee at the rate and in the manner prescribed by law. All other taxes, duties, customs or similar charges shall be the responsibility of the Licensor. 5.5 The Licensor will invoice and the Licensee will pay invoices in the currency to be agreed between the parties in writing. 5.6 The Licensee shall provide the Licensor with annual statements which set out the actual number of Licensee Developers, Application(s) and Production Environment(s) (if applicable) during that period ("Use Statement"). Subject to clause 4, if the actual number of Licensee Developers, Application(s) and Production Environment(s) (if applicable) in the Use Statement exceeds the limit(s) set out on the Quote then the Licensor shall be entitled to charge the Licensee additional appropriate fees for such usage and shall invoice the Licensee annually and in accordance with this clause 5. Such fees shall be determined by the prevailing rate of Licence Fees as of the date of the Use Statement. 5.7 The Licensee shall allow the Licensor, and any auditors of or other advisers to the Licensor, to access the Licensee's (and its Affiliate(s')) personnel, facilities, systems and records as may be reasonably required (provided that the Licensor gives at least five Business Days' notice of its intention to conduct an audit) in order to audit the number of Application(s), Production Environment(s) (if applicable), and Licensee Developers who have used the Licensed Materials and if appropriate to verify the accuracy of any Use Statement. If, following such audit, the Licensor discovers any use which exceeds the numbers set out on the Quote or the number paid for by Licensee during the period audited, the Licensor shall notify the Licensee in writing and the Licensee shall within 15 Business Days pay the additional appropriate Licence Fees which are due and payable. 5.8 Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, the Licensee must pay each valid invoice within 30 days of the date of the invoice. 6. Warranties 6.1 The Licensor represents and warrants that: (a) it has the right to enter into these Terms and to license the Licensed Materials and provide the Support Services (if any) as contemplated by these Terms; (b) the Support Services (if any) shall be performed with reasonable care, skill and diligence; (c) the Licensed Materials and Support Services (if any) shall comply with all applicable laws, regulatory requirements, mandatory standards and codes of practice of any competent authority for the time being in force; and (d) the Software shall perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation for a period of 90 days after the Effective Date, provided that this warranty shall not apply to error or failure resulting from (i) machine error; (ii) the Licensee's failure to follow operating instructions; (iii) negligence or accident; or (iv) modifications to the Software by any person or entity other than the Licensor. 6.2 The Licensee represents and warrants that: (a) it has the right to enter into these Terms and to perform its obligations as contemplated by these Terms; and (b) in the performance of its obligations under these Terms, it shall comply with (and shall procure that its Affiliate(s) shall comply with) all applicable laws, regulatory requirements, mandatory standards and codes of practice of any competent authority for the time being in force. 6.3 The Licensor does not warrant that the operation of the Licensed Materials or the code produced by the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free. The Licensor provides the Licensed Materials on an "as is" basis and all warranties not expressly set out in these Terms, including any warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, are disclaimed to the fullest extent permitted by law. 6.4 The Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of the warranty in clause 6.1(d) shall be to require the Licensor to repair the affected portion of the Software to ensure that it complies with the Documentation. 7. Intellectual Property Rights 7.1 All Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensor Materials and Licensed Materials shall, at all times, be and remain the exclusive property of the Licensor or its third party licensors. 7.2 All Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensee Materials shall, at all times, be and remain the exclusive property of the Licensee or its third party licensors.

In relation to all personal data provided or made available to the Licensor by or on behalf of the Licensee, the Licensor: (a) acknowledges that, as between the parties, it acts only as a processor; (b) shall only process such personal data in accordance with these Terms and the Licensee's instructions issued from time to time; (c) shall immediately inform the Licensee if, in the Licensor's opinion, any instructions given to it by the Licensee in relation to the processing of such personal data under these Terms infringe any Data Protection Legislation; (d) shall implement and operate, and shall procure that any permitted sub-processor implements and operates, appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure: (i) the protection of the rights of the relevant data subjects; and (ii) a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by any processing of such personal data, in particular protection from accidental loss or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed by the Licensor pursuant to these Terms; (e) shall not, without the prior written consent of the Licensee, transfer any such personal data to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless adequate contractual or other assurances have first been put in place such as will enable each party to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Legislation; (f) shall not engage any sub-processor without the prior written consent of the Licensee and then only on the basis of a written contract between the Licensor and the sub-processor which imposes on the sub-processor terms equivalent to the provisions of this clause 11. The Licensor shall be responsible for the management of any permitted sub-processor and its compliance with such terms and shall be directly liable to the Licensee for any breach of the same; (g) shall notify the Licensee without undue delay of any breach of the provisions of this clause 11 and provide assistance to the Licensee in respect of any such breach; (h) shall provide timely cooperation and assistance to the Licensee in ensuring compliance with: (i) the Licensee's obligations to respond to any complaint or request form any applicable data protection authority or data subjects seeking to exercise their rights under any Data Protection Legislation, including by promptly notifying the Licensee of each subject access request the Licensor receives; (ii) the Licensee's obligations set out under Articles 32 – 36 of the GDPR to: (A) ensure the security of the processing; (B) notify the relevant supervisory authority and any data subjects, where relevant, of any personal data breach; (C) carry out any data protection impact assessments ("DPIA") on the impact of the processing on the protection of personal data; and (D) consult the relevant supervisory authority prior to any processing where a DPIA indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the Licensee to mitigate the risk; and (i) shall make available to the Licensee all information reasonably required by the Licensee to demonstrate the Licensor's compliance with its obligations set out in this clause 11 and allow and participate in any data protection audits and inspections conducted by the Licensee or another auditor mandated by the Licensee. 12.

Termination 13.1 Either party may terminate these Terms by giving the other written notice if: (a) the other materially breaches any term of these Terms and it is not possible to remedy that breach; (b) the other materially breaches any term of these Terms and it is possible to remedy that breach, but the other fails to do so within 30 days of being requested in writing to do so; (c) the other suffers or undergoes an Insolvency Event; or (d) the other is delayed in performing its obligations under these Terms under clause 15 for a period of 30 days or more.

If any provision of these Terms is so found to be ineffective or unenforceable but would be effective or enforceable if some part of the provision were deleted, the provision in question shall apply with such modification(s) as may be necessary to make it effective and enforceable. 16.6 All variations to these Terms must be agreed, set out in writing and signed on behalf of both parties before they take effect. 16.7 Except to the extent that these Terms expressly provides otherwise, nothing in these Terms shall or is intended to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties, constitute one party as agent of the other or give either party authority to make or enter into commitments, assume liabilities or pledge credit on behalf of the other party. Neither party may act as if it were, or represent (expressly or by implying it) that it is, an agent of the other or has such authority. 16.8 Each party confirms that, in entering into and performing these Terms, it is acting as principal and not as the agent of any undisclosed third party principal. 16.9 A person who is not a party to these Terms shall not have any rights under or in connection with it, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise. 16.10 The Licensor shall: (a) comply with all applicable laws, statutes, regulations and codes relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, including the Bribery Act 2010 ("Act"); (b) not do anything which would constitute an offence or which would cause the Licensee to commit an offence under the Act; (c) have and shall maintain in place throughout the term of these Terms its own policies and procedures (copies of which will be made available to the Licensee upon request), including adequate procedures to ensure compliance with the Act as informed by the principles outlined in the guidance to the Act, and will enforce them where appropriate; (d) promptly report to the Licensee any request or demand for any undue financial or other advantage of any kind received by the Licensor in connection with the performance of these Terms; and (e) procure that all associated persons (as defined in the Act) of the Licensor will comply with clauses 16.10(a) to (c). A breach of this clause 16.10 by the Licensor shall constitute a material breach entitling the Licensee to terminate these Terms immediately on written notice. 16.11 No terms other than those set out in these Terms shall be applicable between the parties in relation to the subjects covered by these Terms, including without limitation, any terms set out on any purchase orders that have been issued by the Licensee. Provided always that nothing in this clause 16.11 will operate to limit or exclude any liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, no other representations or terms shall apply or form part of these Terms. Each party acknowledges that it has not been influenced to enter these Terms by, and shall have no right or remedy (other than for breach of contract) in respect of, anything the other party has said or done or committed to do, except as expressly recorded in these Terms. 16.12 In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement executed and entered into between the parties in relation to the Licenced Materials, these Terms shall take precedence. 16.13 These Terms are governed by English law. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in relation to any dispute or difference between the parties arising out of or in connection with these Terms, its interpretation or subject-matter, but the Licensor is also entitled to apply to any court worldwide for injunctive or other remedies in order to protect or enforce its Intellectual Property Rights and/or Confidential Information.

Python 3.0a1 License
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see http://www.zope.com). In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

Release	Derived from  	Year	Owner	GPL-compatible? (1)

Footnotes:

    GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

    According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause. According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL. 

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.

Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 SDK

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO 2013 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft

updates,

supplements,

Internet-based services, and

support services

for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.

BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.

If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.

1.   INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. One user may install and use any number of copies of the software with any edition of Visual Studio 2013.  Visual Studio 2013 is licensed separately.

2.   ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.

a.   Distributable Code.The software contains code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.

i.    Right to Use and Distribute. The code and text files listed below are “Distributable Code.”

·       REDIST.TXT Files. You may copy and distribute the object code form of code listed in REDIST.TXT files, plus any files listed on the REDIST list located at:  go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=313603.

·       Sample Code. You may modify, copy, and distribute the source and object code form of code marked as “sample.”

·       Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.

ii.    Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must

·       add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;

·       require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement and, except that with respect to the Visual Studio Shell, you must require your customers to agree to terms that protect the Shell at least as much as its Microsoft Software License Terms, which grant your customers installation and use rights to the Visual Studio Shell;

·       display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and

·       indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.

iii.   Distribution Restrictions. You may not

·       alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;

·       use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;

·       distribute Distributable Code to run on a platform other than the Windows platform;

·       include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or

·       modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that

·       the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or

·       others have the right to modify it.

b.   Developing for the Visual Studio Shell (Integrated and Isolated Modes).  In addition to the requirements and restrictions for Distributable Code described above, the following applies to your programs that work in conjunction with the Visual Studio Shell:

·      Automatic Download Feature.  The Visual Studio Shell includes a feature that will detect whether your customer’s machine contains Microsoft components that are needed for the Visual Studio Shell to run, such as the .NET Framework. Visual Studio Shell will automatically download and install such components over the Internet if they are not present on your customer’s machine. Visual Studio Shell does not notify the user that such components are being installed. You will comply with all applicable laws and notice obligations necessary to inform your customer of this automatic download feature.

·      Visual Studio Shell (Isolated) - Product Information.  You will not alter or hide our Visual Studio sub-branding in the corner of the splash screen of the Visual Studio Shell (Isolated), and you will supply your own primary branding for your programs that work in conjunction with Visual Studio Shell (Isolated) to indicate to your customers that such programs are yours.

·      Limits on Extensions. You will not develop or enable others to develop extensions for Visual Studio that circumvents any technical limitations implemented by Microsoft for integrating with Visual Studio. For example, we have put technical limitations in place in the Visual Studio Shell (Isolated) such that extensions to it may not load certain Microsoft packages (including packages from commercial Visual Studio product software) that may already be installed in the end user’s machine.

 

·       No Degrading Visual Studio.  You will design and test the installation, uninstallation, and operation of your programs to ensure that such processes do not disable any features or adversely affect the functionality of any edition of the Visual Studio family of products.

 

3.   SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not

·       disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the software to any third party without Microsoft’s prior written approval;

·       work around any technical limitations in the software;

·       reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;

·       make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;

·       publish the software for others to copy;

·       rent, lease or lend the software;

·       transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or

·       use the software for commercial software hosting services.

4.   INTERNET BASED SERVICES.   Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.

5.   DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.

6.   EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting .

 

7.   SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.

 

8.   ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

 

9.   APPLICABLE LAW.

i.    United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

ii.    Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

10. LEGAL EFFECT.This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE.

12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to

·       anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

·       claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

	                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General

     and conversions to other media types.

     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
     subsequently incorporated within the Work.

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
     as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
     meet the following conditions:

     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and

     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and

     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.

     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
     the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
