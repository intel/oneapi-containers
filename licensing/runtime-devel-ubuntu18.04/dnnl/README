oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)
===========================================

oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an
open-source performance library for deep learning applications. The library
includes basic building blocks for neural networks optimized
for Intel(R) Architecture Processors, Intel Processor Graphics, and 
Xe Architecture graphics.

This package contains oneDNN v2.5.0 (858c3afce1f1dfe0261d1d73d82ec70b82b01424).

You can find information about the latest version and release notes
at the oneDNN Github (https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/releases).

Documentation
-------------

* Developer guide (https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/v2.5)
  explains the programming model, supported functionality, and implementation
  details, and includes annotated examples.
* API reference (https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/v2.5/modules.html)
provides a comprehensive reference of the library API.

System Requirements
-------------------

oneDNN supports systems based on Intel 64 or AMD64 architectures.

The library is optimized for the following CPUs:
* Intel Atom processors (at least Intel SSE4.1 support is required)
* Intel Core(TM) processors (at least Intel SSE4.1 support is required)
* Intel Xeon(R) processor E3, E5, and E7 family (formerly Sandy Bridge,
  Ivy Bridge, Haswell, and Broadwell)
* Intel Xeon Phi(TM) processor (formerly Knights Landing and Knights Mill)
* Intel Xeon Scalable processor (formerly Skylake, Cascade Lake, and Cooper
  Lake)
* future Intel Xeon Scalable processor (code name Sapphire Rapids)

oneDNN detects the instruction set architecture (ISA) at runtime and uses
just-in-time (JIT) code generation to deploy the code optimized
for the latest supported ISA. Future ISAs may have initial support in the
library disabled by default and require the use of run-time controls to enable
them. See CPU dispatcher control (https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_cpu_dispatcher_control.html)
for more details.

The library is optimized for the following GPUs:
* Intel Processor Graphics based on Gen9, Gen9.5 and Gen11, and Gen12 architectures
* Intel Iris(R) Xe graphics (formerly DG1)
* future Intel Arc(TM) graphics (code name Alchemist and DG2)
