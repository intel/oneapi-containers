All rights reserved.

Theo de Raadt <deraadt@openbsd.org> came up with the idea of using
such a mathematical system to generate more random (yet non-repeating)
ids to solve the resolver/named problem.  But Niels designed the
actual system based on the constraints.

Later modified by Damien Miller to wrap the LCG output in a 15-bit
permutation generator based on a Luby-Rackoff block cipher. This
ensures the output is non-repeating and preserves the MSB twiddle
trick, but makes it more resistant to LCG prediction.

Trial and Beta Licences 3.1 Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, if this is a trial licence, then: (a) clauses 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.8 shall not apply, and the Licensor instead hereby grants the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) a revocable, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-transferable and non-sublicensable licence to install, load, launch, access, run, execute, operate, and archive the Licensed Materials solely for the Licensee's (and its Affiliate(s')) internal evaluation and review purposes to determine whether to enter into a paid licence of the Software and not for any other purpose; (b) clause 12 shall not apply and these Terms shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue: (i) for a period of 60 days; (ii) until the parties enter into new terms for the licensing of the Licensed Materials; or (iii) until either terminated by either party, whichever is first; (c) clauses 5.1, 5.2, 6.1(d) and 8 shall not apply; (d) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) acknowledge that the Software may place watermarks on output (including any software that incorporates any part of the Software), have limited functionality, function for a limited period of time, or limit the functionality or time of functioning of any output. The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) acknowledge that access to and/or use of any files or output created with the Software is entirely at the Licensor's own risk; and (e) notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, the Licensor shall only be required to provide the Evaluation support services as described in paragraph 1.1(a)of Schedule 1. 3.2 During the Term, the Licensor may provide the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) with access to certain Beta Software to trial and test for and on behalf of the Licensor. Where the Licensor gives Licensee and its Affiliate(s) access to such Beta Software the Licensor licences it to the Licensee on a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable basis to install, load, launch, access, run, execute and operate the Beta Software solely for evaluation purposes and to provide feedback on that Beta Software. 3.3 In respect of the Beta Software, the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) agree that:
(a) the Licensor shall have no obligation to provide Support Services; and (b) clause 2.8, clause 9 (other than clause 9.1) and schedules 1 and 2 shall not apply and all other references to Support Services shall be deemed inapplicable. 3.4 Subject always to clause 9.1, the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) acknowledge in respect of its use of Beta Software, it is: (a) a beta version of the Software which may not have been sufficiently tested by the Licensor for general commercial release and therefore may contain bugs and Errors; (b) provided for test and evaluation purposes only; and (c) being used, tested and evaluated by Licensee and its Affiliate(s) at its own risk. 4. Additional licence usage terms 4.1 The Licensee may, from time to time during the Term, purchase additional Application(s), Licensee Developers and/or Production Environment(s) (together referred to as "Authorised Usage") in excess of the number set out on the Quote and the Licensor shall grant use of the Licensed Materials to such additional Licensee Developers in accordance with the provisions of these Terms. 4.2 If the Licensee wishes to purchase additional Authorised Usage, the Licensee shall notify the Licensor in writing. The Licensor shall evaluate such request for additional Authorised Usage and respond to the Licensee with approval or rejection of the request. 4.3 If the Licensor approves the Licensee's request to purchase additional Authorised Usage, the Licensee shall, within 30 days of the date of the Licensor's invoice, pay to the Licensor the relevant fees for such additional Authorised Usage, such fees to be notified by the Licensor to the Licensee in writing. 5. Charges, invoicing and payment 5.1 The Licence Fees will be invoiced by the Licensor annually in advance upon the Effective Date and, thereafter, on each anniversary of the Effective Date during the term of these Terms. 5.2 The Annual Renewal Fee will be invoiced by the Licensor annually in advance upon the Effective Date and, thereafter, on each anniversary of the Effective Date during the term of these Terms. 5.3 The charges for the Annual Renewal Fee shall be subject to annual review and may be increased by the Licensor, on 30 days' prior written notice to the Licensee, not more than once in any 12-month period, with no such increase exceeding the equivalent of the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index over the 12-month period immediately preceding the notice of increase. 5.4 Unless otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, all amounts referred to in these Terms are exclusive of value added tax ("VAT") which, where chargeable by the Licensor, shall be payable by the Licensee at the rate and in the manner prescribed by law. All other taxes, duties, customs or similar charges shall be the responsibility of the Licensor. 5.5 The Licensor will invoice and the Licensee will pay invoices in the currency to be agreed between the parties in writing. 5.6 The Licensee shall provide the Licensor with annual statements which set out the actual number of Licensee Developers, Application(s) and Production Environment(s) (if applicable) during that period ("Use Statement"). Subject to clause 4, if the actual number of Licensee Developers, Application(s) and Production Environment(s) (if applicable) in the Use Statement exceeds the limit(s) set out on the Quote then the Licensor shall be entitled to charge the Licensee additional appropriate fees for such usage and shall invoice the Licensee annually and in accordance with this clause 5. Such fees shall be determined by the prevailing rate of Licence Fees as of the date of the Use Statement. 5.7 The Licensee shall allow the Licensor, and any auditors of or other advisers to the Licensor, to access the Licensee's (and its Affiliate(s')) personnel, facilities, systems and records as may be reasonably required (provided that the Licensor gives at least five Business Days' notice of its intention to conduct an audit) in order to audit the number of Application(s), Production Environment(s) (if applicable), and Licensee Developers who have used the Licensed Materials and if appropriate to verify the accuracy of any Use Statement. If, following such audit, the Licensor discovers any use which exceeds the numbers set out on the Quote or the number paid for by Licensee during the period audited, the Licensor shall notify the Licensee in writing and the Licensee shall within 15 Business Days pay the additional appropriate Licence Fees which are due and payable. 5.8 Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the parties, the Licensee must pay each valid invoice within 30 days of the date of the invoice. 6. Warranties 6.1 The Licensor represents and warrants that: (a) it has the right to enter into these Terms and to license the Licensed Materials and provide the Support Services (if any) as contemplated by these Terms; (b) the Support Services (if any) shall be performed with reasonable care, skill and diligence; (c) the Licensed Materials and Support Services (if any) shall comply with all applicable laws, regulatory requirements, mandatory standards and codes of practice of any competent authority for the time being in force; and (d) the Software shall perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation for a period of 90 days after the Effective Date, provided that this warranty shall not apply to error or failure resulting from (i) machine error; (ii) the Licensee's failure to follow operating instructions; (iii) negligence or accident; or (iv) modifications to the Software by any person or entity other than the Licensor. 6.2 The Licensee represents and warrants that: (a) it has the right to enter into these Terms and to perform its obligations as contemplated by these Terms; and (b) in the performance of its obligations under these Terms, it shall comply with (and shall procure that its Affiliate(s) shall comply with) all applicable laws, regulatory requirements, mandatory standards and codes of practice of any competent authority for the time being in force. 6.3 The Licensor does not warrant that the operation of the Licensed Materials or the code produced by the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free. The Licensor provides the Licensed Materials on an "as is" basis and all warranties not expressly set out in these Terms, including any warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, are disclaimed to the fullest extent permitted by law. 6.4 The Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of the warranty in clause 6.1(d) shall be to require the Licensor to repair the affected portion of the Software to ensure that it complies with the Documentation. 7. Intellectual Property Rights 7.1 All Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensor Materials and Licensed Materials shall, at all times, be and remain the exclusive property of the Licensor or its third party licensors. 7.2 All Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensee Materials shall, at all times, be and remain the exclusive property of the Licensee or its third party licensors.

In relation to all personal data provided or made available to the Licensor by or on behalf of the Licensee, the Licensor: (a) acknowledges that, as between the parties, it acts only as a processor; (b) shall only process such personal data in accordance with these Terms and the Licensee's instructions issued from time to time; (c) shall immediately inform the Licensee if, in the Licensor's opinion, any instructions given to it by the Licensee in relation to the processing of such personal data under these Terms infringe any Data Protection Legislation; (d) shall implement and operate, and shall procure that any permitted sub-processor implements and operates, appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure: (i) the protection of the rights of the relevant data subjects; and (ii) a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by any processing of such personal data, in particular protection from accidental loss or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed by the Licensor pursuant to these Terms; (e) shall not, without the prior written consent of the Licensee, transfer any such personal data to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless adequate contractual or other assurances have first been put in place such as will enable each party to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Legislation; (f) shall not engage any sub-processor without the prior written consent of the Licensee and then only on the basis of a written contract between the Licensor and the sub-processor which imposes on the sub-processor terms equivalent to the provisions of this clause 11. The Licensor shall be responsible for the management of any permitted sub-processor and its compliance with such terms and shall be directly liable to the Licensee for any breach of the same; (g) shall notify the Licensee without undue delay of any breach of the provisions of this clause 11 and provide assistance to the Licensee in respect of any such breach; (h) shall provide timely cooperation and assistance to the Licensee in ensuring compliance with: (i) the Licensee's obligations to respond to any complaint or request form any applicable data protection authority or data subjects seeking to exercise their rights under any Data Protection Legislation, including by promptly notifying the Licensee of each subject access request the Licensor receives; (ii) the Licensee's obligations set out under Articles 32 – 36 of the GDPR to: (A) ensure the security of the processing; (B) notify the relevant supervisory authority and any data subjects, where relevant, of any personal data breach; (C) carry out any data protection impact assessments ("DPIA") on the impact of the processing on the protection of personal data; and (D) consult the relevant supervisory authority prior to any processing where a DPIA indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of measures taken by the Licensee to mitigate the risk; and (i) shall make available to the Licensee all information reasonably required by the Licensee to demonstrate the Licensor's compliance with its obligations set out in this clause 11 and allow and participate in any data protection audits and inspections conducted by the Licensee or another auditor mandated by the Licensee. 12.

Termination 13.1 Either party may terminate these Terms by giving the other written notice if: (a) the other materially breaches any term of these Terms and it is not possible to remedy that breach; (b) the other materially breaches any term of these Terms and it is possible to remedy that breach, but the other fails to do so within 30 days of being requested in writing to do so; (c) the other suffers or undergoes an Insolvency Event; or (d) the other is delayed in performing its obligations under these Terms under clause 15 for a period of 30 days or more.

If any provision of these Terms is so found to be ineffective or unenforceable but would be effective or enforceable if some part of the provision were deleted, the provision in question shall apply with such modification(s) as may be necessary to make it effective and enforceable. 16.6 All variations to these Terms must be agreed, set out in writing and signed on behalf of both parties before they take effect. 16.7 Except to the extent that these Terms expressly provides otherwise, nothing in these Terms shall or is intended to create a partnership or joint venture between the parties, constitute one party as agent of the other or give either party authority to make or enter into commitments, assume liabilities or pledge credit on behalf of the other party. Neither party may act as if it were, or represent (expressly or by implying it) that it is, an agent of the other or has such authority. 16.8 Each party confirms that, in entering into and performing these Terms, it is acting as principal and not as the agent of any undisclosed third party principal. 16.9 A person who is not a party to these Terms shall not have any rights under or in connection with it, whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise. 16.10 The Licensor shall: (a) comply with all applicable laws, statutes, regulations and codes relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, including the Bribery Act 2010 ("Act"); (b) not do anything which would constitute an offence or which would cause the Licensee to commit an offence under the Act; (c) have and shall maintain in place throughout the term of these Terms its own policies and procedures (copies of which will be made available to the Licensee upon request), including adequate procedures to ensure compliance with the Act as informed by the principles outlined in the guidance to the Act, and will enforce them where appropriate; (d) promptly report to the Licensee any request or demand for any undue financial or other advantage of any kind received by the Licensor in connection with the performance of these Terms; and (e) procure that all associated persons (as defined in the Act) of the Licensor will comply with clauses 16.10(a) to (c). A breach of this clause 16.10 by the Licensor shall constitute a material breach entitling the Licensee to terminate these Terms immediately on written notice. 16.11 No terms other than those set out in these Terms shall be applicable between the parties in relation to the subjects covered by these Terms, including without limitation, any terms set out on any purchase orders that have been issued by the Licensee. Provided always that nothing in this clause 16.11 will operate to limit or exclude any liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, no other representations or terms shall apply or form part of these Terms. Each party acknowledges that it has not been influenced to enter these Terms by, and shall have no right or remedy (other than for breach of contract) in respect of, anything the other party has said or done or committed to do, except as expressly recorded in these Terms. 16.12 In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement executed and entered into between the parties in relation to the Licenced Materials, these Terms shall take precedence. 16.13 These Terms are governed by English law. The parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in relation to any dispute or difference between the parties arising out of or in connection with these Terms, its interpretation or subject-matter, but the Licensor is also entitled to apply to any court worldwide for injunctive or other remedies in order to protect or enforce its Intellectual Property Rights and/or Confidential Information.

Python 3.0a1 License
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see http://www.zope.com). In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

Release	Derived from  	Year	Owner	GPL-compatible? (1)
 
0.9.0 thru 1.2  	 	1991-1995	CWI	yes
1.3 thru 1.5.2	1.2	1995-1999	CNRI	yes
1.6	1.5.2	2000	CNRI	no
2.0	1.6	2000	BeOpen.com	no
1.6.1	1.6	2001	CNRI	yes (2)
2.1	2.0+1.6.1	2001	PSF	no
2.0.1	2.0+1.6.1	2001	PSF	yes
2.1.1	2.1+2.0.1	2001	PSF	yes
2.2	2.1.1	2001	PSF	yes

2.3.5	2.3.4	2005	PSF	yes
2.4	2.3	2004	PSF	yes
2.4.1	2.4	2005	PSF	yes
2.4.2	2.4.1	2005	PSF	yes
2.4.3	2.4.2	2006	PSF	yes
2.4.4	2.4.3	2006	PSF	yes
2.5	2.4	2006	PSF	yes
2.5.1	2.5	2007	PSF	yes
3.0	2.6	2007	PSF	yes


Footnotes:

    GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

    According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law clause. According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL. 

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.
