                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, 
the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure 
the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated
software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other
authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think
carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the
better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When
we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library
or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the
library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it
very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not
be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents
pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure
that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent
license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full
freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some
libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the
GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is
quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for
certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative
of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser
General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the
library. We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public
License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in
certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special
need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a
de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other
cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater
number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use
the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although
the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does
ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and
the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The
precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay
close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work
that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it
may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called
"this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you". A "library" means a collection
of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with
application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
executables. The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
is included without limitation in the term "modification".) "Source code" for a work
means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library,
complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent
of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on
what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee
for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to
be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an
argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table,
the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this
function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root
function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of
that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library,
the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim
rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is
to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead
of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the
notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General
Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than
version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these
notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy
part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is
made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a
"work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking
a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a
derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than
a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a "work that uses
the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object
code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code
is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked
without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be
true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical
parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under
Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing
that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the
Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that
uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the
Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering
for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of
the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution
displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code
for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as
object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then
relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library
will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
definitions.) 
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions
into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the
library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. 
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
performing this distribution.
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place. 
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an
executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any
data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as
a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an
executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side
in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this
License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the
terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or
its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on
the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works
based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or
for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a
whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this
section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public
license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or
among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not
specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose
distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you
want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary
General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. one line to give
the library's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) year  name of author

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, 
the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure 
the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated
software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other
authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think
carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the
better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When
we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library
or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the
library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it
very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not
be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents
pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure
that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent
license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full
freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some
libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the
GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is
quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for
certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative
of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser
General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the
library. We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public
License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in
certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special
need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a
de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other
cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater
number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use
the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although
the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does
ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and
the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The
precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay
close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work
that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it
may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called
"this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you". A "library" means a collection
of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with
application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
executables. The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
is included without limitation in the term "modification".) "Source code" for a work
means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library,
complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent
of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on
what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee
for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to
be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an
argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table,
the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this
function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root
function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of
that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do
not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library,
the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim
rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is
to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead
of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the
notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General
Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than
version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these
notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy
part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is
made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a
"work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking
a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a
derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than
a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a "work that uses
the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object
code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code
is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked
without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be
true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical
parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under
Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing
that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the
Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that
uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the
Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering
for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of
the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution
displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code
for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as
object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then
relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library
will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
definitions.) 
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions
into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the
library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. 
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
performing this distribution.
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place. 
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an
executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any
data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as
a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,
unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an
executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side
in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this
License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the
terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or
its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on
the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its
terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works
based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or
for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a
whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this
section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public
license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of
that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or
among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not
specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose
distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED
TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY
AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you
want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary
General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. one line to give
the library's name and an idea of what it does. Copyright (C) year  name of author

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, 
to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written
by James Random Hacker.

All rights reserved.

Theo de Raadt <deraadt@openbsd.org> came up with the idea of using
such a mathematical system to generate more random (yet non-repeating)
ids to solve the resolver/named problem.  But Niels designed the
actual system based on the constraints.

Later modified by Damien Miller to wrap the LCG output in a 15-bit
permutation generator based on a Luby-Rackoff block cipher. This
ensures the output is non-repeating and preserves the MSB twiddle
trick, but makes it more resistant to LCG prediction.

========================================================================================================================

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

SOFTWARE TOOLS LICENSE AGREEMENT

DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS, COPY, OR USE ANY PORTION OF THE MATERIALS (DEFINED BELOW) UNTIL YOU HAVE READ AND ACCEPTED THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE MATERIALS, YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. If You do not agree to be bound by, or the entity for whose benefit You act has not authorized You to accept, these terms and conditions, do not install, access, copy, or use the Software and destroy all copies of the Software in Your possession.

This DEVELOPMENT TOOLS LICENSE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into between Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Intel”) and You. “You” refers to you or your employer or other entity for whose benefit you act, as applicable. If you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind that legal entity to the Agreement, in which case, "You" or "Your" shall be in reference to such entity. Intel and You are referred to herein individually as a “Party” or, together, as the “Parties”.

The Parties, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which they acknowledge, and intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

1. DEFINITIONS. The following definitions are used throughout this Agreement:

“Affiliate” means any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with a Party hereto, where “control” means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of such entity’s capital or equivalent voting rights. An entity will be deemed an “Affiliate” only as long as such control exists during the term of this Agreement.

“Contractor” means a third party consultant or subcontractor who requires access to or use of the Materials to perform work on Your behalf or at Your behest.

“Development Tools” means the development, evaluation, production, or test tool software, and associated documentation or other collateral, identified in the “development_tools.txt” text files, if any, included in the Materials.

“Derivatives” means derivative works as defined in 17 U.S.C § 101 et seq.

“Intel-based Device” means a device designed, manufactured, or configured by You or Your Affiliates to include or operate Intel hardware, software, or services.

"Materials" means the software, documentation, the software product serial number and license key codes (if applicable), Development Tools, Redistributables, and other materials or collateral, including any updates and upgrades thereto, in source code or object code form where applicable, that are provided or otherwise made available by Intel to You under this Agreement. “Materials” do not include Open Source Software or any computer programming code that is subject to an agreement, obligation or license (whether or not accompanying the Materials) intended to supersede this Agreement.

"Redistributables" means the software, documentation, or other collateral identified in the “redist.txt” text files, if any, included in the Materials.

2. LIMITED LICENSE.

(A) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants You and Your Affiliates, a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable, worldwide, fully paid-up license during the term of this Agreement, without the right to sublicense, under Intel’s copyrights (subject to any third party licensing requirements), unless expressly stated otherwise, to:

(1) internally reproduce and install a reasonable number of copies of the Materials for Your internal use solely for the purposes of designing, developing, manufacturing and testing Intel-based Devices;

(2) internally reproduce the source code of the Development Tools, if provided to You by Intel, and to internally create and reproduce Derivatives of the Development Tools, and to internally reproduce the binary code of the Development Tools, or any Derivatives created by You, in each case solely for the purpose of designing, developing, manufacturing and testing the Intel-based Device, solely as necessary for the integration of any Intel software and the output generated by the Development Tools, with and into Intel-based Devices;

(3) create Derivatives of the Redistributables, or any portions thereof, provided to You by Intel in source code form solely for the purposes of designing, developing, debugging, modifying, distributing and testing software containing significantly more functionality and features than the Redistributables in the form provided to You by Intel;

(4) distribute (or otherwise make available) on a royalty-free basis, subject to any other terms and conditions which may appear in the Redistributables text files, the Redistributables, including any Derivatives of the Redistributables pursuant to Section 2(A)(3), or any portions thereof, only as integrated or embedded in software (and not on a stand-alone basis) solely for use on an Intel-based Device; and

(5) have the tasks set forth in Section 2(A)(1) and (2) above performed by a Contractor on the conditions that You enter into a written confidentiality agreement with any such Contractor, subject to Section 7 (Confidentiality), and You remain fully liable to Intel for the actions and inactions of Your Contractors.

(B) You will be liable for Your Affiliate’s breach of these terms. In addition, You acknowledge that Your Affiliates are beneficiaries of the licenses granted by Intel under Section 2.

(C) Intel hereby grants You the right to sub-license (without rights to further sublicense) the Development Tools, including any accompanying documentation, to Your manufacturing partners, in the code format provided to You by Intel, solely for designing, developing, manufacturing and testing the Intel-based Devices solely as necessary for the integration of any Intel software and the output generated by the Development Tools, with and into Intel-based Devices. The sublicense is subject to a written sublicensing agreement that contains confidentiality obligations and license restrictions that are no less protective of Intel than those provided in this Agreement. You will be fully responsible and liable towards Intel for Your sub-licensees’ compliance with all such confidentiality obligations and license restrictions. You may grant Your manufacturing partners the right to further distribute Redistributables solely as integrated or embedded in software for Your Intel-based Devices.

3. LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. All right, title and interest in and to the Materials and associated documentation are and will remain the exclusive property of Intel and its suppliers. Unless expressly permitted under the Agreement, You will not, and will not allow any third party to (i) use, copy, distribute, sell or offer to sell the Materials or associated documentation; (ii) modify, adapt, enhance, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, change or create derivative works from the Materials except and only to the extent as specifically required by mandatory applicable laws or any applicable third party license terms accompanying the Materials; (iii) use or make the Materials available for the use or benefit of third parties; or (iv) use the Materials on Your products other than those that include the Intel product(s), platform(s), or software identified in the Materials; or (v) publish or provide any Materials benchmark or comparison test results.

If You received the Materials solely for evaluation purposes, You have no distribution rights to the Materials or any portion thereof.

Distribution of the Redistributables is also subject to the following conditions: You shall: (i) be solely responsible to Your customers and end users for any update or support obligation or other liability which may arise from the distribution, (ii) not make any statement that Your software is "certified", or that its performance is guaranteed, by Intel, (iii) not use Intel's name or trademarks to promote Your software without prior written permission, (iv) use a license agreement that contains provisions that are at least as restrictive as this Agreement and which prohibits disassembly and reverse engineering of the Materials provided in object code form, and (v) indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Intel, Intel’s Affiliates, and its licensors from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from Your Derivatives or Your distribution of Your software.

The consideration under this Agreement is only for the licenses Intel expressly grants above. Any other rights including, but not limited to, additional patent rights, will require an additional license and additional consideration. Nothing in this Agreement requires or will be treated to require Intel to grant any additional license. You acknowledge that an essential basis of the bargain in this Agreement is that Intel grants You no licenses or other rights including, but not limited to, patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, trade name, service mark or other intellectual property licenses or rights with respect to the Materials and associated documentation, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except for the licenses expressly granted above. You acknowledge there are significant uses of the Materials in their original, unmodified and uncombined form. The consideration for the licenses in this Agreement reflects Intel’s continuing right to assert patent claims against any modifications or derivative works (including, without limitation, error corrections and bug fixes) of, or combinations with, the Materials that You, Your Affiliates or third parties make that infringe any Intel patent claim.

4. LICENSE TO FEEDBACK. This Agreement does not obligate You to provide Intel with materials, information, comments, suggestions, Your Derivatives or other communication regarding the features, functions, performance or use of the Materials (“Feedback”). If any software included in the Materials is provided or otherwise made available by Intel in source code form, to the extent You provide Intel with Feedback in a tangible form, You grant to Intel and its affiliates a non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up and transferable license, to and under all of Your intellectual property rights, whether perfected or not, to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, distribute, import, create derivative works of and otherwise exploit any comments, suggestions, descriptions, ideas, Your Derivatives or other feedback regarding the Materials provided by You or on Your behalf.

5. OPEN SOURCE STATEMENT. The Materials may include Open Source Software (OSS) licensed pursuant to OSS license agreement(s) identified in the OSS comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header(s) provided with or otherwise associated with the Materials. Neither You nor any Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Original Device Manufacturer (ODM), customer, or distributor may subject any proprietary portion of the Materials to any OSS license obligations including, without limitation, combining or distributing the Materials with OSS in a manner that subjects Intel, the Materials or any portion thereof to any OSS license obligation. Nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable OSS license.

6. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. Certain third party software provided with or within the Materials may only be used (a) upon securing a license directly from the owner of the software or (b) in combination with hardware components purchased from such third party and (c) subject to further license limitations by the software owner. A listing of any such third party limitations is in one or more text files accompanying the Materials. You acknowledge Intel is not providing You with a license to such third party software and further that it is Your responsibility to obtain appropriate licenses from such third parties directly.

7. CONFIDENTIALITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement, exchanged confidential information, as well as the Materials are subject to the terms and conditions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement(s) or Intel Pre-Release Loan Agreement(s) (referred to herein collectively or individually as “NDA”) entered into by and in force between Intel and You, and in any case no less confidentiality protection than You apply to Your information of similar sensitivity. If You would like to have a Contractor perform work on Your behalf that requires any access to or use of Materials You must obtain a written confidentiality agreement from the Contractor which contains terms and conditions with respect to access to or use of Materials no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement, excluding any distribution rights and use for any other purpose, and You will remain fully liable to Intel for the actions and inactions of those Contractors. You may not use Intel's name in any publications, advertisements, or other announcements without Intel's prior written consent.

8. NO OBLIGATION; NO AGENCY. Intel may make changes to the Software, or items referenced therein, at any time without notice. Intel is not obligated to support, update, provide training for, or develop any further version of the Software or to grant any license thereto. No agency, franchise, partnership, joint- venture, or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this Agreement.

9. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES. THE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

THE LIMITED REMEDIES, WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN INTEL AND YOU AND INTEL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE MATERIALS WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.

11. TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL. Intel may terminate this Agreement for any reason with thirty (30) days’ notice and immediately if You or someone acting on Your behalf or at Your behest violates any of its terms or conditions. Upon termination You will immediately destroy and ensure the destruction of the Materials (including providing certification of such destruction or return back to Intel). Upon termination of this Agreement, all licenses granted to You hereunder terminate immediately. All Sections of this Agreement, except Section 2, will survive termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the license grant to any Redistributables, including Your Derivatives of the Redistributables, distributed by You prior to the effective date of such termination and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall survive any such termination of this Agreement.

In the event the Materials are exported from the U.S.A. or re-exported from a foreign destination by You, Your subsidiaries, or Your Affiliates, You will ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the Materials complies with all laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government.

14. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The Materials are a commercial item (as defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101) consisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation (as those terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R 227.7202- 1 through 227.7202-4, You will not provide the Materials to the U.S. Government.

16. ASSIGNMENT. You may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license(s) granted or any of Your rights or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without Intel’s express prior written consent, will be null and void. Intel may assign, delegate and transfer this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.

17. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement and any NDA with Intel constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and merge and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions. Neither Party will be bound by any terms, conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings, or representations with respect to the subject matter hereof other than as expressly provided herein. In the event any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, instead such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within legal limits.

18. WAIVER. The failure of a Party to require performance by the other Party of any provision hereof will not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will waiver by a Party of a breach of any provision hereof constitute a waiver of the provision itself.

19. PRIVACY. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE SET FORTH IN INTEL’S PRIVACY NOTICE, WHICH FORMS A PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. PLEASE REVIEW THE PRIVACY NOTICE AT HTTP://WWW.INTEL.COM/PRIVACY TO LEARN HOW INTEL COLLECTS, USES AND SHARES INFORMATION ABOUT YOU.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
