11. PowerShell openssh-portable

	This file is part of the OpenSSH software.

	The licences which components of this software fall under are as
	follows.  First, we will summarize and say that all components
	are under a BSD licence, or a licence more free than that.

	OpenSSH contains no GPL code.

	1)
		 * Copyright (c) 1995 Tatu Ylonen <ylo@cs.hut.fi>, Espoo, Finland
		 *                    All rights reserved
		 *
		 * As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
		 * can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
		 * software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
		 * incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
		 * called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

		[Tatu continues]
		 *  However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or
		 * copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that
		 * are not under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included
		 * source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements
		 * and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most
		 * restrictive); see below for details.

		[However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time.  All of
		these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about
		have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,

		 - RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library
		 - IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated
		 - DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library
		 - GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL
		 - Zlib is now external, in a library
		 - The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included
		 - TSS has been removed
		 - MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library
		 - RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL
		 - Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library

		[The licence continues]

		Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this
		software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major
		bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide.  More
		information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".

		The legal status of this program is some combination of all these
		permissions and restrictions.  Use only at your own responsibility.
		You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
		making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in
		your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.


					NO WARRANTY

		BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
		FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
		OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
		PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
		OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
		MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
		TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
		PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
		REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

		IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
		WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
		REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
		INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
		OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
		TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
		YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
		PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
		POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

15. libarchive


	The libarchive distribution as a whole is Copyright by Tim Kientzle
	and is subject to the copyright notice reproduced at the bottom of
	this file.

	Each individual file in this distribution should have a clear
	copyright/licensing statement at the beginning of the file.  If any do
	not, please let me know and I will rectify it.  The following is
	intended to summarize the copyright status of the individual files;
	the actual statements in the files are controlling.

	* Except as listed below, all C sources (including .c and .h files)
	  and documentation files are subject to the copyright notice reproduced
	  at the bottom of this file.

	* The following source files are also subject in whole or in part to
	  a 3-clause UC Regents copyright; please read the individual source
	  files for details:
	   libarchive/archive_entry.c
	   libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c
	   libarchive/archive_write_add_filter_compress.c
	   libarchive/mtree.5

	* The following source files are in the public domain:
	   libarchive/archive_getdate.c

	* The following source files are triple-licensed with the ability to choose
	  from CC0 1.0 Universal, OpenSSL or Apache 2.0 licenses:
	   libarchive/archive_blake2.h
	   libarchive/archive_blake2_impl.h
	   libarchive/archive_blake2s_ref.c
	   libarchive/archive_blake2sp_ref.c

	* The build files---including Makefiles, configure scripts,
	  and auxiliary scripts used as part of the compile process---have
	  widely varying licensing terms.  Please check individual files before
	  distributing them to see if those restrictions apply to you.

	I intend for all new source code to use the license below and hope over
	time to replace code with other licenses with new implementations that
	do use the license below.  The varying licensing of the build scripts
	seems to be an unavoidable mess.

		 institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		 cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		 or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		 or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		 granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		 as of the date such litigation is filed.

	  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
		 Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
		 modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
		 meet the following conditions:

		 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
			 Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

			 of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
			 as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
			 documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
			 within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
			 wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
			 of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
			 do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
			 notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
			 or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
			 that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
			 as modifying the License.

		 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		 the conditions stated in this License.

	  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		 by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
		 this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

		 whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		 unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		 negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		 liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		 on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		 of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

		  and conversions to other media types.

		  "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

		  form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
		  editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
		  represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
		  of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
		  separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
		  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

		  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

		  worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
		  copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

		  Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

		  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
		  by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
		  Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
		  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
		  institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
		  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
		  or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
		  or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
		  granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
		  as of the date such litigation is filed.

			  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

		  (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
			  stating that You changed the files; and

			  the Derivative Works; and

		  (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
			  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
			  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
			  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
			  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
			  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
			  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
			  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
			  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
			  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
			  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
			  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
			  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
			  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
			  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
			  as modifying the License.

		  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
		  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
		  for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
		  for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
		  the conditions stated in this License.

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
		  any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
		  by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

		  the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
		  with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
		  names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

		  origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
		  agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
		  Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
		  WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
		  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
		  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
		  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
		  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
		  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
		  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
		  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
		  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
		  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
		  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
		  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
		  the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		  and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		  or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
		  License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
		  on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
		  of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		  defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
		  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
		  of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	 Version 2.1, February 1999

	 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

	[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
	 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
	 the version number 2.1.]

								Preamble

	  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
	freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
	Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
	free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

	  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
	specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
	Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
	can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
	this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
	strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
	not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
	you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
	for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
	it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
	it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
	these things.

	  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
	distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
	rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
	you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

	  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
	or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
	you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
	code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
	complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
	with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
	it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

	  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
	library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
	permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

	  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
	there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
	modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
	that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
	author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
	introduced by others.

	  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
	any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
	effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
	restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
	any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
	consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

	  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
	ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
	General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
	is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
	this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
	libraries into non-free programs.

	  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
	a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
	combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
	General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
	entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
	Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
	the library.

	  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
	does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
	Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
	of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
	are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
	libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
	special circumstances.

	  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
	encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
	a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
	allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
	library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
	case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
	software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

	  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
	programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
	free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
	non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
	operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
	system.

	  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
	users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
	linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
	that program using a modified version of the Library.

	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
	modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
	"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
	former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
	be combined with the library in order to run.

					  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

	  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
	program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
	other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
	this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
	Each licensee is addressed as "you".

	  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
	prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
	(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

	  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
	which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
	Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
	copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
	portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
	straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
	included without limitation in the term "modification".)

	  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
	making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
	all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
	interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
	and installation of the library.

	  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
	covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
	running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
	such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
	on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
	writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
	and what the program that uses the Library does.

	  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
	complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
	you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
	appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
	all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
	warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
	Library.

	  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
	and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
	fee.

	  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
	of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
	distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
	above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

		a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

		b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
		stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

		c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
		charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

		d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
		table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
		the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
		is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
		in the event an application does not supply such function or
		table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
		its purpose remains meaningful.

		(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
		a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
		application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
		application-supplied function or table used by this function must
		be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
		root function must still compute square roots.)

	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
	identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
	and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
	themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
	sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
	distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
	this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
	entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
	it.

	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
	your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
	exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
	collective works based on the Library.

	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
	with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
	a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
	the scope of this License.

	  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
	License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
	this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
	that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
	instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
	ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
	that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
	these notices.

	  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
	that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
	subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

	  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
	the Library into a program that is not a library.

	  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
	derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
	under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
	it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
	must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
	medium customarily used for software interchange.

	  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
	from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
	source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
	distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
	compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

	  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
	Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
	linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
	work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
	therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

	  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
	creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
	contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
	library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
	Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

	  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
	that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
	derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
	Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
	linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
	threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

	  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
	structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
	functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
	file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
	work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
	Library will still fall under Section 6.)

	  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
	distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
	Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
	whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

	  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
	link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
	work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
	under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
	modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
	engineering for debugging such modifications.

	  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
	Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
	this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
	during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
	copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
	directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
	of these things:

		a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
		machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
		changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
		Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
		with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
		uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
		user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
		executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
		that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
		Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
		to use the modified definitions.)

		b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
		Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
		copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
		rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
		will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
		the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
		interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

		c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
		least three years, to give the same user the materials
		specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
		than the cost of performing this distribution.

		d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
		from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
		specified materials from the same place.

		e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
		materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

	  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
	Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
	reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
	the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
	normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
	components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
	which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
	the executable.

	  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
	restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
	accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
	use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
	distribute.

	  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
	Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
	facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
	library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
	the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
	permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

		a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
		based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
		facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
		Sections above.

		b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
		that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
		where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

	  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
	the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
	attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
	distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
	rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
	or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
	terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

	  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
	signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
	distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
	prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
	modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
	Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
	all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
	the Library or works based on it.

	  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
	Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
	original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
	subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
	restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
	this License.

	  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
	infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
	conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
	distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
	may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
	license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
	all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
	the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
	refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
	particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
	and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
	integrity of the free software distribution system which is
	implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
	generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
	to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
	impose that choice.

	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
	be a consequence of the rest of this License.

	  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
	certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
	original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
	an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
	so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
	excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
	written in the body of this License.

	  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
	versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
	Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
	but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
	specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
	"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
	conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
	the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
	license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
	the Free Software Foundation.

	  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
	programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
	write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
	copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
	Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
	decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
	of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
	and reuse of software generally.

								NO WARRANTY

	  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
	WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
	EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
	OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
	KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
	IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
	PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
	LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
	THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

	  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
	WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
	AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
	FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
	CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
	LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
	RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
	FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
	SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
	DAMAGES.

	 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
	 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
	 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

								Preamble

	  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
	freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
	License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
	software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
	General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
	Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
	using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
	the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
	your programs, too.

	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
	this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
	if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
	in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

	  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
	anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
	These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
	distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

	  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
	gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
	you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
	source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
	rights.

	  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
	(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
	distribute and/or modify the software.

	  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
	that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
	software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
	want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
	that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
	authors' reputations.

	  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
	patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
	program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
	program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
	patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
	modification follow.

						GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
	   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

	  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
	a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
	under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
	refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
	means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
	that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
	either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
	language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
	the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
	covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
	running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
	is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
	Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
	Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

	  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
	source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
	conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
	copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
	notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
	and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
	along with the Program.

	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
	you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

	  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
	of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
	distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
	above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

		a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
		stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

		b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
		whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
		part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
		parties under the terms of this License.

		c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
		when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
		interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
		announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
		notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
		a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
		these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
		License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
		does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
		the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
	identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
	and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
	themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
	sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
	distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
	on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
	this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
	entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
	your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
	exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
	collective works based on the Program.

	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
	with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
	a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
	the scope of this License.

	  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
	under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
	Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

		a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
		source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
		1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

		b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
		years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
		cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
		machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
		distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
		customarily used for software interchange; or,

		c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
		to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
		allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
		received the program in object code or executable form with such
		an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

	The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
	making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
	code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
	associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
	control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
	special exception, the source code distributed need not include
	anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
	form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
	operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
	itself accompanies the executable.

	If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
	access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
	access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
	distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
	compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

	  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
	except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
	otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
	void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
	However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
	this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
	parties remain in full compliance.

	  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
	signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
	distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
	prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
	modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
	Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
	all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
	the Program or works based on it.

	  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
	Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
	original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
	these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
	restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
	You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
	this License.

	  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
	infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
	conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
	distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
	may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
	license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
	all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
	the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
	refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
	any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
	apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
	circumstances.

	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
	patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
	such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
	integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
	implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
	generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
	through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
	system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
	to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
	impose that choice.

	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
	be a consequence of the rest of this License.

	  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
	certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
	original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
	may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
	those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
	countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
	the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

	  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
	of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
	be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
	address new problems or concerns.

	Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
	specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
	later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
	either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
	Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
	this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
	Foundation.

	  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
	programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
	to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
	Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
	make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
	of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
	of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

								NO WARRANTY

	  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
	FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
	OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
	PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
	OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
	MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
	TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
	PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
	REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

	  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
	REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
	INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
	OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
	TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
	YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
	PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
	POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

						 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

				How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

	  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
	possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
	free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

	  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
	to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
	convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
	the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

		<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
		Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

		This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
		it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
		the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
		(at your option) any later version.

		This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
		but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
		MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
		GNU General Public License for more details.

		You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
		with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
		51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

	Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

	If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
	when it starts in an interactive mode:

		Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
		Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
		This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
		under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

	The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
	parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
	be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
	mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

	You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
	school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
	necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

	  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
	  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

	  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
	  Ty Coon, President of Vice

	This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
	proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
	consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
	library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
	Public License instead of this License.
