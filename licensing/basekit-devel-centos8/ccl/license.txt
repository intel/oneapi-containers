13. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

 13.1 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement contains the complete and exclusive 
      agreement and understanding between the parties concerning the subject 
      matter of this Agreement, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous 
      proposals, agreements, understanding, negotiations, representations, 
      warranties, conditions, and communications, oral or written, between the 
      parties relating to the same subject matter. This Agreement, including 
      without limitation its termination, has no effect on any signed NDA 
      between the parties, which remain in full force and effect as separate 
      agreements to their terms. Each party acknowledges and agrees that in 
      entering into this Agreement it has not relied on, and will not be 
      entitled to rely on, any oral or written representations, warranties, 
      conditions, understanding, or communications between the parties that are 
      not expressly set forth in this Agreement. The express provisions of this 
      Agreement control over any course of performance, course of dealing, or 
      usage of the trade inconsistent with any of the provisions of this 
      Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement will prevail notwithstanding 
      any different, conflicting, or additional provisions that may appear on 
      any purchase order, acknowledgement, invoice, or other writing issued by 
      either party in connection with this Agreement. No modification or 
      amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed
      by authorized representatives of each party, and must specifically 
      identify this Agreement by its title and version (e.g., "Intel End User 
      License Agreement for Developer Tools (Version September 2019)"); except 
      that Intel may make changes to the Agreement as it distributes new 
      versions of the Materials. When changes are made, Intel will make a new 
      version of the Agreement available on its website. If You received a copy
      of this Agreement translated into another language, the English language 
      version of this Agreement will prevail in the event of any conflict 
      between versions. 

 13.2 EXPORT. You acknowledge that the Materials and all related technical 
      information are subject to export controls and you agree to comply with 
      all laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable 
      governments governing export, re-export, import, transfer, distribution, 
      and use of the Materials. In particular, but without limitation, the 
      Materials may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed 
      countries or (b) to any person or entity listed on a denial order 
      published by the U.S. government or any other applicable governments. By 
      using the Materials, You represent and warrant that You are not located in
      any such country or on any such list. You also agree that You will not use
      the Materials for, or sell or transfer them to a third party who is known 
      or suspected to be involved in, any purposes prohibited by the U.S. 
      government or other applicable governments, including, without limitation,
      the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, 
      chemical or biological weapons.

 13.3 GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE. All disputes arising out of or 
      related to this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, or any other 
      legal or equitable theory, will in all respects be governed by, and 
      construed and interpreted under, the laws of the United States of America 
      and the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws 
      principles. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on 
      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) is specifically 
      excluded from and will not apply to this Agreement. All disputes arising 
      out of or related to this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, or 
      any other legal or equitable theory, will be subject to the exclusive 
      jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or of the Federal 
      courts sitting in that State. Each party submits to the personal 
      jurisdiction of those courts and waives all objections to that 
      jurisdiction and venue for those disputes.

 13.4 SEVERABILITY. The parties intend that if a court holds that any provision 
      or part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable 
      law, the court will modify the provision to the minimum extent necessary 
      to make it valid and enforceable, or if it cannot be made valid and 
      enforceable, the parties intend that the court will sever and delete the 
      provision or part from this Agreement. Any change to or deletion of a 
      provision or part of this Agreement under this Section will not affect the
      validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement, which will 
      continue in full force and effect.
