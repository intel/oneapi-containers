# Intel<sup>®</sup> oneAPI Containers

Intel<sup>®</sup> oneAPI products will deliver the tools needed to deploy applications and solutions across scalar, vector, matrix, and spatial (SVMS) architectures. Its set of complementary toolkits—a base kit and specialty add-ons—simplify programming and help developers improve efficiency and innovation. [oneAPI Details](https://software.intel.com/oneapi)

Containers allow you to set up and configure environments for profiling and distribute them using images:

* You can install an image containing an environment pre-configured with all the tools you need, then develop within that environment.
* You can save an environment and use the image to move that environment to another machine without additional setup.
* You can prepare containers with different sets of languages and runtimes, analysis tools, or other tools, as needed.
* You can use runtime containers to execute your applications built with oneAPI toolkits.

# Using containers behind a proxy

If you are behind a proxy, you may need to add proxy settings with `docker run` commands: `-e http_proxy="$http_proxy" -e https_proxy="$https_proxy"`

For example:

```sh
docker run --device=/dev/dri -e http_proxy="$http_proxy" -e https_proxy="$https_proxy" -it "$image"
```

# Using Intel Advisor/Inspector/vTune with containers

When using these tools, extra capabilites have to be provided to the container: `--cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE`

```sh
docker run --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --device=/dev/dri -it "$image"
```
